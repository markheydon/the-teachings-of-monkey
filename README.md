# The Teachings of Monkey

An open source archive of wisdom, nonsense, and camp from the cult TV series *Monkey* (*Saiyūki*).

Each episode ends with a short narrated teaching — a pearl of wisdom distilled from chaos, demons, pilgrims, and Pigsy’s antics. This site collects those teachings, episode by episode, alongside commentary, fan reflections, and playful extras.
