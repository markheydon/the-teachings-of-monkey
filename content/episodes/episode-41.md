## Synopsis
A demon casts an enormous shadow that grows with each victory, feeding on fear and triumph alike. Monkey's pride makes him the perfect target — the more he fights, the stronger the shadow becomes. Only by accepting defeat can the pilgrims move forward.

## Teaching
*"The shadow we cast is shaped not by our strength, but by the light we block. Step aside, and darkness disappears."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy's terror of the shadow leads to comic cowering and unhelpful suggestions.

## Commentary
A meditation on ego and humility, this episode uses the shadow as a brilliant metaphor for how pride creates its own obstacles. Monkey's struggle to let go is both philosophical and deeply entertaining.
