## Synopsis
Pigsy and Sandy accidentally drink from a magical fertility well, leading to the absurd situation of both becoming pregnant. Monkey and Tripitaka must deal with the chaos while continuing their journey west.

## Teaching
*"Even blessings can become burdens when sought without wisdom. Responsibility lies not in desire, but in foresight."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷 — Pregnant Pigsy chaos at its finest.

## Commentary
This episode leans fully into farce, contrasting slapstick humour with a moral about responsibility. Pigsy’s antics remind us that indulgence without foresight leads to unexpected burdens.
