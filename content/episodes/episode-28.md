## Synopsis
A pack of demonic dogs terrorises a village, hunting anyone who shows fear. The pilgrims must face the hounds without flinching, proving that courage is the ultimate weapon against terror.

## Teaching
*"Fear gives the beast its fangs. Face it without trembling, and it becomes harmless."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy's terror is palpable, and predictably comic.

## Commentary
A tense episode that explores the power of fear. Pigsy's panicked flight from the dogs provides levity while reinforcing the lesson: running from fear only makes it stronger.
