## Synopsis
A holy saint is revealed to be a catfish demon in disguise, while a shape-changer sows confusion among the pilgrims. Monkey's sharp instincts and Tripitaka's faith are tested as they navigate layers of deception.

## Teaching
*"Holiness can be mimicked, but true virtue reveals itself through action, not appearance."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷 — Solid nonsense: Pigsy is duped by the disguises and blunders accordingly.

## Commentary
The episode's triple-threat of deception — catfish, saint, and shape-changer — creates a delightful puzzle. It's a masterclass in the series' recurring theme: never trust what you see, only what you discern.
