## Synopsis
A dream demon traps the pilgrims in nested layers of illusion, where waking becomes dreaming and reality becomes impossible to discern. Only clear-minded awareness can break the cycle.

## Teaching
*"Reality is not what appears, but what remains when illusion dissolves. The mind awake sees truth."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy can't tell if he's awake or asleep, but his appetite remains constant.

## Commentary
A mind-bending episode that plays with perception and consciousness. Pigsy's grounding in physical needs—hunger, comfort—becomes ironically useful in navigating the surreal.
