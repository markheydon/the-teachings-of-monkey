## Synopsis
The pilgrims debate the nature of wisdom as they face a demon who offers three paths: knowledge, power, or compassion. Each choice tests a different virtue, revealing that wisdom is not one answer, but many.

## Teaching
*"Wisdom is not a destination, but a journey. It wears many faces, and all are true."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy chooses the path of least effort, proving wisdom can be accidental.

## Commentary
A philosophical centrepiece that questions the very premise of the journey. Pigsy's bumbling path turns out to be unexpectedly wise, proving that simplicity has its own truth.
