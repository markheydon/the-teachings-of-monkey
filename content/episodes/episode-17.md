## Synopsis
A demon wielding grey gloves possesses the power to manipulate truth itself, turning allies against each other. The pilgrims must navigate a web of lies where even their own perceptions cannot be trusted.

## Teaching
*"Truth is not what we see, but what remains when illusion is stripped away."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy falls for the demon's deceptions, creating confusion but no major disasters.

## Commentary
The Grey Gloves Devil epitomises the series' fascination with deception. Truth becomes a battleground, and Monkey's sharp wit proves more valuable than his staff.
