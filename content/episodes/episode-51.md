## Synopsis
An emperor claims dominion over heaven and earth, demanding the pilgrims acknowledge his supreme authority. His power seems absolute — until Tripitaka questions what it means to rule. The emperor's empire crumbles when he realises authority without consent is merely tyranny.

## Teaching
*"True power serves, it does not command. The greatest ruler is one who leads without forcing others to follow."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷 — Unusually subdued in the presence of such overwhelming authority, Pigsy mostly hides behind Sandy.

## Commentary
A political episode that questions the nature of power and leadership. The emperor's fall is both dramatic and philosophical, making this one of the series' more thought-provoking instalments as it nears its conclusion.
