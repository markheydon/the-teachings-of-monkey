## Synopsis
A wolf demon preys on a village by exploiting hunger — both physical and spiritual. The pilgrims arrive during a famine, and the demon offers food in exchange for souls. Pigsy's appetite makes him an easy target, but his moment of selflessness saves the day.

## Teaching
*"Hunger can make us desperate, but it cannot make us cruel. What we choose when starving reveals who we truly are."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy nearly trades everything for a feast before redeeming himself in the final act.

## Commentary
One of Pigsy's finest moments — his struggle between appetite and conscience feels genuine. The wolf demon is a memorable villain, and the episode's message about sacrifice resonates deeply.
