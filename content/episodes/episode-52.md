## Synopsis
The pilgrims finally reach the Western Heaven. But the journey's end is not what they expected — no grand ceremony, no ultimate reward. Instead, they find that the true scriptures were the lessons learned along the way. The journey transforms them more than the destination ever could.

## Teaching
*"The path is the teaching. Those who seek only the destination miss the journey that shapes them."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy complains about the lack of a banquet at the end, but even he understands the journey's meaning.

## Commentary
A fitting conclusion that honours the series' philosophical heart. Rather than a triumphant ending, it offers quiet reflection — the pilgrims have changed, and that change is the real victory. Camp, profound, and perfectly *Monkey*.
