## Synopsis
The pilgrims seek shelter in a seemingly abandoned mansion, only to discover it's haunted by a vengeful spirit. The demon feeds on guilt and regret, forcing each pilgrim to confront their past.

## Teaching
*"The past is a prison we build ourselves. Forgiveness is the key that sets us free."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy's regrets are predictably food and romance-related, but surprisingly genuine.

## Commentary
A gothic horror episode with emotional depth. Pigsy's confrontation with his past gluttony and failed romances adds unexpected pathos to his usual buffoonery.
