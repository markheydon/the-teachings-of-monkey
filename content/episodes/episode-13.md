## Synopsis
A seductive minx demon and her slug companion terrorise a village, using charm and slime to ensnare victims. Pigsy falls for the minx's allure while Monkey battles the grotesque slug. The contrast between beauty and horror is camp gold.

## Teaching
*"Seduction and repulsion are twin faces of desire. See through both to find truth."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷🐷 — Major disruption: Pigsy's lust for the minx derails the rescue mission.

## Commentary
A Christmas Eve broadcast that delivers festive absurdity. The minx-and-slug duo is peak Monkey weirdness — glamorous villainy paired with grotesque comedy. Pigsy's predictable downfall adds to the charm.
