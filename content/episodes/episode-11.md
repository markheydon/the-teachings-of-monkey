## Synopsis
A demon who controls day and night plunges a village into eternal darkness, demanding tribute. Monkey must outwit the celestial trickster to restore balance. The episode explores the duality of light and shadow, wisdom and ignorance.

## Teaching
*"Darkness cannot exist without light. Balance is found not in choosing one, but in understanding both."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷 — Background chaos: Pigsy complains about the dark but contributes little to the solution.

## Commentary
A visually striking episode that plays with themes of illusion and cosmic order. Monkey's cunning shines as he unravels the demon's scheme, proving that even celestial powers can be undone by wit.
