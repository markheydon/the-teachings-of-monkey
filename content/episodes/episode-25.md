## Synopsis
The pilgrims enter a land where dreams and reality blur. A demon feeds on fear, trapping victims in nightmares that feel all too real. Only by confronting their deepest anxieties can the pilgrims escape.

## Teaching
*"Fear is a dream we mistake for reality. Courage wakes us to truth."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy's nightmares involve food shortages and romantic rejection, naturally.

## Commentary
A genuinely eerie episode that plays with the boundary between sleeping and waking. Pigsy's anxieties are predictably comic, but they ground the surreal in character-driven humour.
