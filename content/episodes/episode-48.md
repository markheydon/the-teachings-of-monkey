## Synopsis
A fierce warrior woman challenges the pilgrims, refusing to let them pass until they prove their worth through combat. She's immune to Monkey's tricks and Pigsy's charm. Only when Tripitaka refuses to fight does she reveal her true purpose — testing their commitment to non-violence.

## Teaching
*"True strength is knowing when not to fight. The warrior who seeks peace is mightier than the one who seeks victory."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy tries to flirt his way out of combat and fails miserably.

## Commentary
A refreshing change of pace with a strong female character who isn't a demon in disguise. Her tenacity and the episode's focus on non-violent resolution make it a standout in the later seasons.
