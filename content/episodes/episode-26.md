## Synopsis
The pilgrims encounter a false temple claiming to be the journey's end. A demon disguised as Buddha tests their faith and resolve, offering them release from their quest if they abandon their purpose.

## Teaching
*"The true path has no shortcuts. The journey itself is the destination."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy nearly abandons the quest for promised luxury.

## Commentary
This episode questions what enlightenment truly means. Pigsy's temptation to quit for comfort contrasts sharply with Tripitaka's unwavering commitment to the journey, no matter the hardship.
