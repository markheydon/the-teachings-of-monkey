## Synopsis
A demon's gaze turns victims to stone, creating a garden of petrified travellers. Monkey's usual bravado makes him vulnerable, as looking directly at the demon means instant petrification. The solution requires humility, trust, and fighting blind.

## Teaching
*"Not all battles are won by facing the enemy. Sometimes, turning away is the bravest choice."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy's terror leads to eyes-shut stumbling and near-petrification multiple times.

## Commentary
A tense episode with genuine stakes — the stone garden imagery is haunting. Watching Monkey learn to trust his companions rather than rely on his own sight adds unexpected character development.
