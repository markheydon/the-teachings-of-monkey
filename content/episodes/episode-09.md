## Synopsis
A dog demon kidnaps a village girl, and Monkey’s crew must sniff out the truth behind the beast’s disguise. Pigsy’s appetite and Monkey’s mischief collide as the gang faces illusions, canine chaos, and a lesson in seeing past appearances.

## Teaching
*"Appearances deceive. True nature is revealed by actions, not looks."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷🐷 — Major disruption: Pigsy mistakes the demon for a tasty snack and causes a ruckus.

## Commentary
Monkey’s sharp tongue and Pigsy’s bottomless stomach are on full display. The episode’s playful take on illusion versus reality is classic Monkey—expect slapstick, snorts, and a lesson about not judging by looks alone.
