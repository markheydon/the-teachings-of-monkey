## Synopsis
The pilgrims arrive in a land scorched by two suns, where crops wither and villagers suffer. A demon has created a false sun to drain the land's vitality. Monkey must restore balance by destroying the imposter.

## Teaching
*"Balance is the foundation of life. Too much of even a good thing brings ruin."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy complains endlessly about the heat but contributes little.

## Commentary
An allegory about excess and balance. The dual suns represent how abundance can become destruction, a lesson Pigsy fails to grasp as he lounges in the shade.
