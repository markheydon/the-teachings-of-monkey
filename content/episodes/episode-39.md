## Synopsis
The pilgrims discover a legendary fountain that promises eternal youth. But the demon guarding it reveals that immortality without purpose is a curse. Pigsy's desire to drink nearly traps them all in eternal stagnation.

## Teaching
*"Youth is wasted on the young, and immortality on the foolish. Life's meaning lies in its fleeting nature."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy's quest for eternal gluttony reaches peak absurdity.

## Commentary
A poignant meditation on mortality and meaning. Pigsy's desire for endless feasting becomes a cautionary tale about the emptiness of existence without purpose or end.
