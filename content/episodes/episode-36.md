## Synopsis
A pompous philosopher claims to have unlocked the secrets of the universe, but his theories are exploited by a demon to sow confusion. The pilgrims must teach him that wisdom comes from experience, not intellect alone.

## Teaching
*"Knowledge without action is empty noise. True wisdom is lived, not spoken."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy mocks the philosopher's pretensions, proving folk wisdom can trump philosophy.

## Commentary
A satire of intellectual arrogance. Pigsy's common-sense approach—eat, sleep, survive—exposes the philosopher's empty theorising as demon-fed delusion.
