## Synopsis
A demon of impeccable manners and genuine charm befriends the pilgrims, offering hospitality and assistance. But his politeness masks a sinister plan to slowly drain their life force through prolonged comfort. The greatest danger comes wrapped in kindness.

## Teaching
*"Evil does not always bare its fangs. The sweetest poison is served with a smile."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy loves the demon's hospitality and refuses to believe anything's wrong until it's nearly too late.

## Commentary
A deliciously subversive episode that inverts the monster-of-the-week formula. The demon's charm makes him more memorable than many overtly threatening villains, proving that menace comes in many forms.
