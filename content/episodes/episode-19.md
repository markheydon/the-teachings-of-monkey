## Synopsis
The pilgrims encounter a vampire demon who drains not blood, but life force itself. Tripitaka becomes the target, and Monkey must confront an enemy who cannot be defeated by strength alone.

## Teaching
*"Life cannot be hoarded or stolen. It flows freely to those who give, not those who take."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy's terror of vampires leads to chaotic attempts at self-preservation.

## Commentary
A rare foray into gothic horror, this episode blends Eastern mythology with Western vampire lore. The result is camp, creepy, and quintessentially Monkey.
