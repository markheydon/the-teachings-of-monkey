## Synopsis
Each pilgrim encounters a vision of their mother, testing their emotional attachments and memories. The demon feeds on nostalgia and grief, trapping victims in false reunions. Tripitaka must help the others see that clinging to the past prevents moving forward.

## Teaching
*"Love for those we've lost honours their memory, but living in the past dishonours the present. Let go to truly remember."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy's emotional breakdown is equal-parts touching and absurd, complete with exaggerated wailing.

## Commentary
Surprisingly poignant for a show known for camp and chaos. The emotional stakes feel genuine, even as Pigsy's melodrama provides comic relief. A rare moment of vulnerability for the entire cast.
