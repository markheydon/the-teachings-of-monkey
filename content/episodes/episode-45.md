## Synopsis
Demons create perfect duplicates of the pilgrims to discredit their quest and spread chaos. Villages turn against Tripitaka when his "double" commits terrible acts. The real pilgrims must prove their identity through deeds, not words.

## Teaching
*"Reputation is easily tarnished but slowly rebuilt. Actions speak louder than accusations."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷🐷 — Fake Pigsy is somehow even more gluttonous and lecherous than the real one, much to Pigsy's indignation.

## Commentary
An identity crisis episode with comedic gold — watching Pigsy argue with his even-worse duplicate is peak camp. The philosophical questions about authenticity add unexpected depth.
