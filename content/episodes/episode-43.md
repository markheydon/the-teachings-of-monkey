## Synopsis
The pilgrims enter a village where every act of generosity is magically repaid, but every selfish deed is punished tenfold. Pigsy's greed leads to instant karma, while Tripitaka's selflessness creates unexpected complications when villagers begin exploiting his kindness.

## Teaching
*"Generosity without wisdom enables dependency. True compassion empowers others to stand on their own."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy's attempts to game the system backfire spectacularly at every turn.

## Commentary
A sharp exploration of the complexities of altruism. The episode cleverly shows that blind generosity can be as harmful as selfishness, making it one of the more thought-provoking instalments.
