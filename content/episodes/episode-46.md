## Synopsis
A demon traps souls inside beautiful paintings, creating a gallery of frozen victims. Tripitaka is nearly added to the collection when he pauses to admire the artwork. Monkey must enter the paintings themselves to free the trapped souls.

## Teaching
*"Beauty can be a cage as well as a gift. Appreciate without attachment, or become what you admire."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy is captivated by portraits of beautiful maidens and nearly gets trapped himself.

## Commentary
A visually striking episode that plays with the idea of art as both creation and imprisonment. The surreal imagery of Monkey fighting inside paintings is pure *Monkey* magic — weird, wonderful, and memorable.
