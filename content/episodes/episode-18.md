## Synopsis
A plague of demonic locusts descends upon a village, devouring everything in sight. The pilgrims must discover the source of the swarm and stop it before the land is reduced to barren waste.

## Teaching
*"Greed devours all it touches. Restraint is the only harvest that endures."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy's gluttony mirrors the locusts' consumption, creating comic parallels and near-disasters.

## Commentary
The locust plague serves as a metaphor for unchecked appetite — a theme perfectly embodied by Pigsy himself. Nature's fury meets demonic mischief in classic Monkey style.
