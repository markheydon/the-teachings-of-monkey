## Synopsis
Pigsy tumbles into an enchanted well while searching for water, only to discover it's a demon's trap. The pilgrims must rescue him before he becomes the centrepiece of an aquatic banquet. His clumsiness turns a simple task into yet another chaotic misadventure.

## Teaching
*"Haste leads to disaster. Patience reveals the path forward."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷🐷 — Major disruption: Pigsy's bumbling nearly drowns the quest before it begins.

## Commentary
Pigsy's talent for falling into trouble — quite literally — is on full display. The episode balances slapstick with genuine peril, reminding us that carelessness invites danger. Classic Monkey camp with a message about staying alert.
