## Synopsis
Pigsy is mistaken for a king by desperate villagers and briefly enjoys the perks of royalty. When demons exploit his vanity, Pigsy must choose between comfort and duty — a rare moment of character growth.

## Teaching
*"A crown does not make a king, nor robes a god. True leadership is earned through service, not title."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷 — Peak Pigsy delusion: he believes his own royal fantasy until reality crashes down.

## Commentary
Pigsy's brief reign is both hilarious and touching. For once, his inflated ego becomes the lesson rather than just the punchline.
