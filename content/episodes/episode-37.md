## Synopsis
A demon steals the pilgrims' identities, creating perfect duplicates that force each to question who they truly are. Only by confronting their deepest selves can they reclaim their identities.

## Teaching
*"Identity is not what others see, but what we choose to become. We are defined by our actions, not our reflections."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy vs. Pigsy is double the chaos, naturally.

## Commentary
An existential episode exploring selfhood and authenticity. Two Pigsys means twice the gluttony, twice the lust, and twice the laughs.
