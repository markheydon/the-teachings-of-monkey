## Synopsis
A demon enchants the pilgrims with music that forces them to dance until they collapse from exhaustion. The curse can only be broken by someone who refuses to move to the rhythm. Sandy's stoic resistance becomes the key to their salvation.

## Teaching
*"Not all invitations deserve acceptance. Knowing when to refuse is as important as knowing when to join."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy dances with wild abandon, embracing the chaos with ridiculous enthusiasm.

## Commentary
A wonderfully camp episode that showcases Sandy's underappreciated steadiness. The image of Pigsy flailing about in demonic disco is pure *Monkey* gold — absurd, memorable, and oddly profound.
