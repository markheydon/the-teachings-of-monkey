The pilgrims find themselves in a liminal space between celestial and infernal realms. A demon judge forces them to account for their actions, weighing their virtues against their sins. Only honesty can tip the scales.

*"Judgment is not imposed from above, but earned through action. We are the sum of our choices."*

## Pigsy Nonsense Rating
🐷🐷🐷🐷 — Pigsy's list of sins is comically long, but his sincerity saves him.
