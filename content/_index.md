# The Teachings of Monkey

Welcome to **The Teachings of Monkey** — an open source archive of wisdom, nonsense, and camp from the cult TV series *Monkey* (*Saiyūki*).

Each episode ends with a short narrated teaching: a pearl of wisdom distilled from chaos, demons, pilgrims, and Pigsy’s antics. This site collects those teachings, episode by episode, alongside commentary, and playful extras.

If you're itching for wisdom, swing over to the [**Monkey Teachings**](/extras/monkey-teachings/) page; otherwise, stick around and explore the wild wonders this archive has in store.
