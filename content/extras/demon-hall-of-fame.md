Every week, the pilgrims face a new demon — some terrifying, some ridiculous, all memorable. Here are the standouts who earned a place in the Hall of Fame.

---

## 1. **[The Well Demon (Episode 10)](/episodes/episode-10/)**
An aquatic ambusher who turns a simple well into a watery trap. Nearly makes Pigsy the centrepiece of an underwater banquet.

---

## 2. **[The Day-Night Demon (Episode 11)](/episodes/episode-11/)**
A celestial trickster who controls day and night, plunging villages into eternal darkness. Undone by Monkey's wit.

---

## 3. **[The Pearl Demon (Episode 12)](/episodes/episode-12/)**
Offers cursed magical pearls that drain victims' life force. Exploits Pigsy's greed to near-fatal effect.

---

## 4. **[The Minx and Slug Duo (Episode 13)](/episodes/episode-13/)**
A seductive minx paired with a grotesque slug companion. The contrast between glamour and slime is peak Monkey weirdness.

---

## 5. **[The Catfish Saint (Episode 14)](/episodes/episode-14/)**
A catfish demon disguised as a holy saint. Proof that even holiness can be mimicked by demons.

---

## 6. **[The Demon Digger (Episode 15)](/episodes/episode-15/)**
A tunnel-dwelling demon who traps the pilgrims in an underground labyrinth. Tests their unity and resourcefulness.

---

## 7. The Spider Demon Sisters (Episode 26)
Masters of illusion, weaving webs both literal and metaphorical. Their disguises nearly ensnare Tripitaka, proving that beauty can be the deadliest trap.

---

## 8. The False Buddha (Episode 33)
A demon who impersonates enlightenment itself. His downfall is a lesson in discernment: not all wisdom is true wisdom.

---

## 9. The Shape-Shifting Fox (Episode 17)
A trickster who cycles through disguises faster than Pigsy cycles through excuses. His schemes collapse under Monkey’s sharp eye.

---

## 10. The Demon Chef (Episode 42)
Turns gluttony into a weapon, luring Pigsy with promises of feasts. Proof that appetite can be a battlefield.

---

## 11. **[The Dog Demon (Episode 9)](/episodes/episode-09)**
The Dog Demon uses disguise and deception to snatch a village girl, but is ultimately undone by Monkey’s cunning and Pigsy’s appetite.

---

The Hall of Fame celebrates the creativity of *Monkey’s* villains — equal parts menace and camp comedy.
