Every week, the pilgrims face a new demon — some terrifying, some ridiculous, all memorable. Here are the standouts who earned a place in the Hall of Fame.

---

## 1. **[The Well Demon (Episode 10)](/episodes/episode-10/)**
An aquatic ambusher who turns a simple well into a watery trap. Nearly makes Pigsy the centrepiece of an underwater banquet.

---

## 2. **[The Day-Night Demon (Episode 11)](/episodes/episode-11/)**
A celestial trickster who controls day and night, plunging villages into eternal darkness. Undone by Monkey's wit.

---

## 3. **[The Pearl Demon (Episode 12)](/episodes/episode-12/)**
Offers cursed magical pearls that drain victims' life force. Exploits Pigsy's greed to near-fatal effect.

---

## 4. **[The Minx and Slug Duo (Episode 13)](/episodes/episode-13/)**
A seductive minx paired with a grotesque slug companion. The contrast between glamour and slime is peak Monkey weirdness.

---

## 5. **[The Catfish Saint (Episode 14)](/episodes/episode-14/)**
A catfish demon disguised as a holy saint. Proof that even holiness can be mimicked by demons.

---

## 6. **[The Demon Digger (Episode 15)](/episodes/episode-15/)**
A tunnel-dwelling demon who traps the pilgrims in an underground labyrinth. Tests their unity and resourcefulness.

---

## 7. **[The Most Monstrous Monster (Episode 16)](/episodes/episode-16/)**
A demon whose terrifying appearance conceals unexpected complexity. Challenges the pilgrims to look beyond surface horror.

---

## 8. **[The Grey Gloves Devil (Episode 17)](/episodes/episode-17/)**
A master manipulator who wields truth itself as a weapon, turning allies against each other through carefully crafted lies.

---

## 9. **[The Locust King (Episode 18)](/episodes/episode-18/)**
Commands a plague of demonic locusts that devour entire villages. Embodies the destructive power of unchecked greed.

---

## 10. **[The Vampire Master (Episode 19)](/episodes/episode-19/)**
Drains life force rather than blood, blending Eastern and Western demon lore into gothic horror. Defeated by serene resolve.

---

## 11. **[Wun-Lung and the Three Witches (Episode 22)](/episodes/episode-22/)**
The undead demon and his witch allies create a trap powered by belief itself. A genuinely eerie supernatural threat.

---

## 12. The Spider Demon Sisters (Episode 26)
Masters of illusion, weaving webs both literal and metaphorical. Their disguises nearly ensnare Tripitaka, proving that beauty can be the deadliest trap.

---

## 13. The False Buddha (Episode 33)
A demon who impersonates enlightenment itself. His downfall is a lesson in discernment: not all wisdom is true wisdom.

---

## 14. The Demon Chef (Episode 42)
Turns gluttony into a weapon, luring Pigsy with promises of feasts. Proof that appetite can be a battlefield.

---

## 15. **[The Dog Demon (Episode 9)](/episodes/episode-09)**
The Dog Demon uses disguise and deception to snatch a village girl, but is ultimately undone by Monkey’s cunning and Pigsy’s appetite.

The Hall of Fame celebrates the creativity of *Monkey’s* villains — equal parts menace and camp comedy.
