Every week, the pilgrims face a new demon — some terrifying, some ridiculous, all memorable. Here are the standouts who earned a place in the Hall of Fame.

---

## 1. The Spider Demon Sisters (Episode 26)
Masters of illusion, weaving webs both literal and metaphorical. Their disguises nearly ensnare Tripitaka, proving that beauty can be the deadliest trap.

---

## 2. The Fish Demon (Episode 12)
Emerges from the river with a plan as slippery as his scales. His aquatic antics remind us that danger lurks beneath calm waters.

---

## 3. The False Buddha (Episode 33)
A demon who impersonates enlightenment itself. His downfall is a lesson in discernment: not all wisdom is true wisdom.

---

## 4. The Shape-Shifting Fox (Episode 17)
A trickster who cycles through disguises faster than Pigsy cycles through excuses. His schemes collapse under Monkey’s sharp eye.

---

## 5. The Demon Chef (Episode 42)
Turns gluttony into a weapon, luring Pigsy with promises of feasts. Proof that appetite can be a battlefield.

---

## 6. The Dog Demon (Episode 9)
The Dog Demon uses disguise and deception to snatch a village girl, but is ultimately undone by Monkey’s cunning and Pigsy’s appetite.

The Hall of Fame celebrates the creativity of *Monkey’s* villains — equal parts menace and camp comedy.
