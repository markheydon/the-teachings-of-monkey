Pigsy, the gluttonous, lustful, endlessly chaotic pig‑demon, is the beating heart of *Monkey's* camp nonsense. Here are his top moments of pure Pigsy mayhem.

---

## 1. **[Pigsy's Well Disaster (Episode 10)](/episodes/episode-10/)**
**Snort Score:** 🐷🐷🐷🐷  
Pigsy tumbles into an enchanted well, turning a simple water run into a near-drowning fiasco. Classic bumbling.

---

## 2. **[Pearls Before Swine (Episode 12)](/episodes/episode-12/)**
**Snort Score:** 🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷  
Pigsy's greed for magical pearls nearly costs the pilgrims their lives. The title says it all.

---

## 3. **[The Minx Seduction (Episode 13)](/episodes/episode-13/)**
**Snort Score:** 🐷🐷🐷🐷  
Pigsy falls for a seductive minx demon, derailing the rescue mission with predictable lust-driven chaos.

---

## 4. **[Pigsy Woos a Widow (Episode 8)](/episodes/episode-08/))**
**Snort Score:** 🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷  
Pigsy falls head‑over‑hooves for a grieving widow, only to be duped by demons. Classic Pigsy: lust first, wisdom later.

---

## 5. Two Little Blessings (Episode 23)
**Snort Score:** 🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷  
Pigsy and Sandy drink from a fertility well and end up pregnant. Peak absurdity, waddling around with mock labour pains.

---

## 6. **[Monkey Meets the Demon Digger (Episode 15)](/episodes/episode-15/)**
**Snort Score:** 🐷🐷🐷🐷  
Pigsy eats a demon's enchanted food and becomes the unwitting weapon of chaos. His stomach is both his downfall and his superpower.

---

## 7. Pigsy the Matchmaker (Episode 31)
**Snort Score:** 🐷🐷🐷  
Pigsy tries to play Cupid, but his advice is so misguided it nearly derails the pilgrims' mission. Romance Pigsy‑style is always doomed.

---

## 8. Pigsy vs. the Demon Chef (Episode 42)
**Snort Score:** 🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷  
Pigsy's appetite collides with a demon's culinary trap. The result: food fight, farce, and a moral about gluttony.

---

## 9. **[Pigsy vs. the Dog Demon (Episode 9)](/episodes/episode-09/)**
**Snort Score:** 🐷🐷🐷🐷  
Pigsy mistakes the dog demon for dinner, causing chaos and nearly getting the pilgrims eaten instead.

---

Pigsy's antics remind us that chaos can be just as entertaining as wisdom — and sometimes, the nonsense *is* the lesson.
