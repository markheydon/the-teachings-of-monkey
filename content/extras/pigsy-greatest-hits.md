Pigsy, the gluttonous, lustful, endlessly chaotic pig‑demon, is the beating heart of *Monkey’s* camp nonsense. Here are his top five moments of pure Pigsy mayhem.

---

## 1. Pigsy Woos a Widow (Episode 8)
**Snort Score:** 🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷  
Pigsy falls head‑over‑hooves for a grieving widow, only to be duped by demons. Classic Pigsy: lust first, wisdom later.

---

## 2. Two Little Blessings (Episode 23)
**Snort Score:** 🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷  
Pigsy and Sandy drink from a fertility well and end up pregnant. Peak absurdity, waddling around with mock labour pains.

---

## 3. Pigsy’s Magic Tummy (Episode 15)
**Snort Score:** 🐷🐷🐷🐷  
Pigsy eats a demon’s enchanted food and becomes the unwitting weapon of chaos. His stomach is both his downfall and his superpower.

---

## 4. Pigsy the Matchmaker (Episode 31)
**Snort Score:** 🐷🐷🐷  
Pigsy tries to play Cupid, but his advice is so misguided it nearly derails the pilgrims’ mission. Romance Pigsy‑style is always doomed.

---

## 5. Pigsy vs. the Demon Chef (Episode 42)
**Snort Score:** 🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷  
Pigsy’s appetite collides with a demon’s culinary trap. The result: food fight, farce, and a moral about gluttony.

---

## 6. Pigsy vs. the Dog Demon (Episode 9)
**Snort Score:** 🐷🐷🐷🐷  
Pigsy mistakes the dog demon for dinner, causing chaos and nearly getting the pilgrims eaten instead.

Pigsy’s antics remind us that chaos can be just as entertaining as wisdom — and sometimes, the nonsense *is* the lesson.
