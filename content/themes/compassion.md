## Key Episodes
- **[Episode 2: Monkey Turns Nursemaid](/episodes/episode-02/)**
  *Teaching:* Compassion tempers chaos. Strength without care is no strength at all.
- **[Episode 8: Pigsy Woos a Widow](/episodes/episode-08/)**
  *Teaching:* Lust blinds judgment. True vision comes from compassion, not desire.
- **[Episode 32: The House of the Evil Spirit](/episodes/episode-32/)**
  *Teaching:* The past is a prison we build ourselves. Forgiveness is the key that sets us free.
- **[Episode 34: The Tormented Emperor](/episodes/episode-34/)**
  *Teaching:* Power without compassion creates its own prison. Even emperors must answer for their deeds.
- **[Episode 19: The Demon Bride](/episodes/episode-19)**
  *Teaching:* True compassion resists false seduction.
- **[Episode 40: Better the Demon You Know](/episodes/episode-40/)**
  *Teaching:* Trust must be earned, but suspicion without cause creates the very betrayal it fears.
- **[Episode 43: Give and Take](/episodes/episode-43/)**
  *Teaching:* Generosity without wisdom enables dependency. True compassion empowers others to stand on their own.
- **[Episode 51: The Emperor of All](/episodes/episode-51/)**
  *Teaching:* True power serves, it does not command. The greatest ruler is one who leads without forcing others to follow.

Compassion is the pilgrims’ greatest weapon — stronger than Monkey’s staff or Sandy’s strength.
