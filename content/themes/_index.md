# Themes of Wisdom

The teachings of *Monkey* are more than episodic morals — they form recurring themes that echo across the journey.  
This section groups episodes by their deeper lessons.

## Core Themes
- **Self‑Discipline** — Monkey’s impulsiveness vs Tripitaka’s restraint.  
- **Compassion** — Seeing beyond appearances, even when demons deceive.  
- **Illusion vs Reality** — Discernment in a world of trickery.  
- **Unity** — The pilgrims’ squabbles contrasted with cooperation.

Explore these themes to see how wisdom emerges from chaos.
